# Defective_Tiles_Project

Throughout my apprenticeship in [Casalgrande Padana S.p.A](https://www.casalgrandepadana.it/) in 2021, I developed a prototype of an application committed to storing information about the defective pieces produced by the company.
It consists on a web application that communicates with a database (in SQL Server) in order to visualize the previously entered pieces and to send information referring to a new defective piece.

The web app is developed with HTML, CSS, JS and PHP to handle the back-end jobs.
Bootstrap was involved as well to shorten the design management.
